# Temporary-website-whitelist-using-an-invite-code
A simple MySQLi and PHP verification system, which allows you to generate a desired number of codes, whose will then be stored in a database. The codes mentioned can then be queried in the registration system and are then deleted upon approval, so that no further access is possible.

# Let me know
Please let me know if you want any other feature to be added to this project.
I am thinking of a limited use feature for codes, or make the codes expire after some time.

Also let me know if you find any security issues/risks within in my project, so I can sort them out asap.
